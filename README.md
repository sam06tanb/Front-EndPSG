# Simulated Game Sales Website 

## Overview

This project is a **Simulated Game Sales Website** designed to mimic the functionality of a real-world game store. Users can browse, search, and "purchase" games (no real transactions are made). The project serves as an academic or training purpose platform, allowing contributors to gain experience in both **frontend** and **backend** development, utilizing a variety of modern technologies.

The site **does not involve any actual financial transactions** and is purely a simulated environment for demonstrating e-commerce functionalities.
